Hi there!
I'm a physical oceanographer at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton.
Iâ€™m primarily interested in the physical processes governing the overflows of dense water between ocean basins.
To address the targets of my research I run ocean general circulation models and I combine the numerical solutions with available observations.

During my PhD I studied the dynamics controlling the ocean circulation in the vicinity of Denmark Strait, advised by Prof. Tom Haine.
